###Where is computer vision compelling on a spectrum of speculation and representation?
*What is on the screen is material
*model the courtyard accurately (using photogrammetry)
*past, present, futreu models (comparison)
*when buildings look like renderings
*expectations of representation (precision)
*degree to which captures mimic algorithms
*values and memory associated with vision
*model as wrapper
*interior-exterior relation
*suspicious architecture: amount surveillance, security
*transparent architecture: opennes, not shady corners
*same set, multiple outcomes
*not knowing, no complete control

PROMPT: How compelling is computer vision on a spectrum of speculation and representation:

PRACTICAL QUESTION:
SURFACE TYPES: stone, transparent glass, reflective glass, sculptural, flat, texture, natural, pattern, text
WRAPPER TYPES: 
VISION INTERPRETION: new textures (from workflow), glitches, bubbles, stitches, deforms, warped,
