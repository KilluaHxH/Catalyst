##03-10-2015 Day 2

###Where is computer vision compelling on a spectrum of speculation and representation?
* What is on the screen is material
* model the courtyard accurately (using photogrammetry)
* past, present, futreu models (comparison)
* when buildings look like renderings
* expectations of representation (precision)
* degree to which captures mimic algorithms
* values and memory associated with vision
* model as wrapper
* interior-exterior relation
* suspicious architecture: amount surveillance, security
* transparent architecture: opennes, not shady corners
* same set, multiple outcomes
* not knowing, no complete control

PROMPT: How compelling is computer vision on a spectrum of speculation and representation:

* PRACTICAL QUESTION:
* SURFACE TYPES: stone, transparent glass, reflective glass, sculptural, flat, texture, natural, pattern, text
* WRAPPER TYPES: 
* VISION INTERPRETION: new textures (from workflow), glitches, bubbles, stitches, deforms, warped,

##03-12-2015 Day 4
* Why build a model?
* Spectrum of representation + speculation?
* What new insights into facades can CV give us?

--- expressing traversals
--- designing for affordances (actions, relations)
--- expressing how humans and computers understand space together
--- the affordances of space (not just objects)
--- enable the dulication of orientation
--- blurring boundaries between nature and artifice
--- movement as form of space

###FOCUS

&&& traversal 
&&& affordance (of space)
&&& blur + equality
&&& duplication (of ornamentation)

* What are the main ideas driving your work?
* Relationship between you and computer in design? (dragging design)
* What role does movement play in process? To what extent are the models about movement? About vishion?
* Collage in 3D? Attention to ronament?
* How to express a variety of traversals?
* How to understand movement through space around you (wher body is not the objext)?
* Are we modelling affordances? Actions?
